# Mad-Libs

The goal of this C++ program is to create a version of game Mad Libs. 
Given a text file with the story, the program will ask the user to fill in the blanks. 
The program will then show the user the final story. 
Word Template Games Mad Libs are a type of word template game. 
A story is written with multiple blank spaces. 
The game has two players. One player asks the other for words to fill in the blanks. 
The player suggesting words does not know what the story is or what the words are for. 
Once all the blanks have been filled in, the story is read. 
Since the person suggesting the words does not know the context, this will lead to a funny but nonsensical story.
